               <p> I think I want to talk about Gorillaz today! Music is a big part of who I am, and I really want to share it with people.
                   <br>
                   My first real deep dive into Gorillaz was when I got a bass. Nobody is a wonderful musician on the first day, and so I 
                   did as most do and searched up easy songs to play. The Feel Good Inc. bassline really inspired me to take a look
                   at other Gorillaz songs. Surprisingly, most have this catchy yet simplistic bassline that is missing from music these days.
                   For example, if any bassists want reccomendations, "on melancholy hill", "o green world", and "the pink phantom" all have easy
                   yet fun bass riffs. 

                   My favorite Gorillaz video features a live of,  "o green world," and in that one, you can really feel the bass. Not to mention
                   The bassist is in front, absolutely shredding. Watch her go! She really encapsulates that rough Gorillaz theme Demon Days goes for.

              <h1>My Very First Blog Post - 2025-02-06 </h1>
              <p> 
                Hello! It's currently 4:58 PM and I am trying to write with a cat on my elbow. What should I post? Maybe for my first post,
                I can talk about something simple. This website, maybe? I'll probably have a separate page for it later on, but this is fine for now.
                Speaking of my website - this website is special to me because it's my very first serious attempt! I would probably still be stuck
                trying to figure out how to code buttons if it wasn't for my great friend Daniel. 
                I really enjoy how it turned out. It's not fancy, but it's sentimental to me and something I'll definitely show off to my friends in class.
              </p>
              <br>
