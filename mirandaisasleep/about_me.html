            <h2> Hello! My name is Miranda, as you already know. </h2>
            <br>
            <p> I'm a Canadian girl, 16 years old.. Am I allowed to admit that on neocities? I'll have to check soon.
              <br>
              I live in the East Coast, where absolutely nobody knows. It's a maritime province, mostly surrounded by water. Our province even looks like a fish on the map! <br>
              I currently have many hobbies, and I'm still in school. I enjoy both arts and stem, but since school mostly favors stem, I do one thing vastly more than the other. <br>
              I'm not in any clubs currently. Our school is small, and the only reason I'm staying is to hopefully get my grubby hands on a scholarship. <br>
              But: lets talk about something better, no?
